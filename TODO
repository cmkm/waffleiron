x - tablet in portrait mode display
y - laptop for landscape mode display

1 - big-ass title ✓
    includes logo and one-liner
    * also needs to include my name! and website/github/twitter

2 - bulleted info ✓
    what it is, what it does
    - "SASS CSS preprocessor used to break apart and include needed 
        components."
    - "Phantom.js used via screencap gem to automatically create screenshots 
        of games."
    - "Google's webfont library and integration with COLOURlovers public API 
        make it easy for users to quickly create a great-looking game."
    - (or just move the above to (5) and talk about more general things)
    * include link to it running and maybe a QR code for ppl who want to try 
        it on their phones

3 - screenshots (2-3)
    show off the UI and example games
    example game: waffle facts
    
4 - benefits vs ppt ✓
    - portability
        "Similar quiz games are usually made with a tired old Microsoft 
        PowerPoint template. This requires you to have the Office suite 
        installed. Games generated by waffleiron require only a modern 
        web browser, and a zipped archive of your game can be downloaded 
        at any time."
    - editability - even w/o waffleiron
        "Flexbox model makes it easy to modify your game, even if you 
        no longer want to use waffleiron to do so. Generated HTML and CSS 
        is short and clean."
    - mobility - responsive
        "Responsive layout makes it easy to play along on a phone or tablet 
        without having to scroll forever."

5 - ?✓
    - ??? :(
    - maybe put stuff from (2) here and just talk about something else there
    - "Roll your own Jeopardy-style quiz game in 10 minutes"
    - "Supports traditional text questions and images; audio and video to be 
        added"
    - "Created with student study groups and teachers in mind. The goal of 
        waffleiron is to make it easy for end users to make useful (maybe 
        even fun) study tools that look and play great without needing 
        technical knowledge, and without requiring lots of time to customize 
        an existing template."
        
6 - future enhancements ✓
    - audio and video content in questions
    - security, integrate clam antivirus to scan user-submitted files
    - make games public, let others play
    - scorekeeping javascript widget
    - integration with Quizlet's API to pull information from flash card sets
        created on their service
